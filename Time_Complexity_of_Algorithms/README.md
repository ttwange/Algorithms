Time Complexity of Algorithms
Introduction to Time Complexity
In this course, you will learn how to analyze how good an algorithm is in terms of speed and memory. Simply put, an algorithm is a program or function that solves some specific problem. For example, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that, given a list of values, outputs that same list of values but rearranges them in increasing (or decreasing) order.
